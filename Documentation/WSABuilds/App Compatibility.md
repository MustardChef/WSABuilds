## Issues / Support

We can't offer support for the Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) or Android apps.
Instead, try asking the folks that hang out in the [WSA Community Discord](https://discord.gg/2thee7zzHZ) or [WSA subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSA/). Good luck!

## Support table (OS features)

| Feature | Support level | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Multi-touch | ‚úÖ | Demo: [Arcaea](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ph411n7M5)
| Virtual Wifi (VirtWifi) | ‚úÖ
| Bluetooth | ‚ùå
| IPv6 | ‚úÖ | Loading `ipv6.google.com` in Fennec F-Droid on a PC with IPv6 access, works well
| Fingerprint Reader | ‚ùå | Test failed on ROG Flow X13, with SATRIA app
| VPN | ‚ö†Ô∏è | VPNs may not work as intended
| OpenGL ES 3.1 | ‚ùå
| Vulkan | ‚úÖ | Added as experimental feature in [2307.40000.2.0](https://github.com/microsoft/WSA/discussions/374)

### Workarounds

#### VPN

There is no `com.android.vpndialogs` in WSA. However, it's possible to manually grant the VPN activation permission with AppOps via `adb shell`:

```shell
appops set [package name] ACTIVATE_VPN allow
```

#### Launching Android Apps with URI scheme

Microsoft provides a custom URI scheme for WSA, making it easier to launch apps:

```shell
wsa://[App Package Name]
```

For example, to launch Apple Music in WSA, use:

```shell
wsa://com.apple.android.music
```

| eGovPH | 1.9.1 | 13 | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Tested on a WSA install with GMS.  The app doesn't start properly if you didn't grant the permissions beforehand in android settings. For eReport, the app can't progress beyond the Current Location permission prompt as clicking the "Enable Location" doesn't do anything (even with the location permission granted for WSA in Windows); the workaround is to access it via the Suggested eGovPH Services part (found on the Home tab). eKYC verification is problematic as the built-in laptop camera is wonky with eGovPH's image handling, affecting the verification process (this also applies if you're registering an account from the same laptop for its face verification). Some pages display no content (notably FAQs and application details on some devices) |  Basic features work such as navigating through the app features/pages. The PhilSys Digital ID page works as well and able to recognize it in the verification site on my phone. Recommended to use an up-to-date version of Android System WebView since the app mostly relies on it.
