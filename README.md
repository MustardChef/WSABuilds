   <summary><img style="float: right;" src="https://img.icons8.com/color/96/null/software-installer.png" width="60" height="60"/><h1> &nbsp; Installation<h1></summary>

&nbsp;

> **Note** : 
> If you have the official Windows Subsystem For Android™ installed, you must [completely uninstall](#uninstallation) it to use MagiskOnWSA. 

> In case you want to preserve your data from the previous installation (official or MagiskOnWSA), you can backup %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\userdata.vhdx before uninstallation and restore it after installation.

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/releases/latest)
2. In the latest release, go to the Assets section and download the Windows Subsystem For Android™ version of your choosing (do not download "Source code")
3. Extract the zip file
4. Delete the zip file
5. Move the newly extracted folder to a suitable location (Documents folder is a good choice), as you will need to keep the folder on your PC to use MagiskOnWSA

> **Note** :  
> If you're updating WSA, merge the folders and replace the files for all items when asked

6. Open the Windows Subsystem For Android™ folder: Search for and double-click `Run.bat`
   - If you previously have a MagiskOnWSA installation, it will automatically uninstall the previous one while preserving all user data and install the new one, so don't worry about your data.
   - If the popup windows disappear without asking administrative permission and Windows Subsystem For Android™ is not installed successfully, you should manually run Install.ps1 as administrator:
      
      - Press Win+x and select Windows™ Terminal (Admin)
      
      - Input the command below and press enter, replacing {X:\path\to\your\extracted\folder} including the {} with the path of the extracted folder
        ```Powershell
        cd "{X:\path\to\your\extracted\folder}"
        ```  
        
      - Input the command below and press enter   
        ```Powershell
        PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Install.ps1
        ```
        
      - The script will run and Windows Subsystem For Android™ will be installed
      - If this workaround does not work, your PC is not supported for WSA
      
7. Once the installation process completes, Windows Subsystem For Android™ will launch (if this is a first-time install, a window asking for consent to diagnositic information will be shown instead. Sometimes two identical windows will show, this is fine and nothing bad happens if you click OK in both windows)
8. Click on the PowerShell window, then press any key on the keyboard, the PowerShell window should close
9. Close File Explorer
10. **Enjoy**

&nbsp;

### Notice (Applicable for both Windows 10 and 11):

1. You can NOT delete the Windows Subsystem For Android™ installation folder.
   What `Add-AppxPackage -Register .\AppxManifest.xml` does is to register an appx package with some existing unpackaged files,
   so you need to keep them as long as you want to use Windows Subsystem For Android™. 
   Check https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/appx/add-appxpackage?view=windowsserver2022-ps for more details.
2. You need to register your Windows Subsystem For Android™ appx package before you can run Windows Subsystem For Android™. 
   For [WSABuilds](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds) and [MagiskOnWSALocal](https://github.com/LSPosed/MagiskOnWSALocal) users, you need to run `Run.bat` in the extracted dir.
   If the script fails, you can take the following steps for diagnosis (admin privilege required):
    1. Open a PowerShell window and change working directory to your Windows Subsystem For Android™ directory.
    
    2. Run the command below in PowerShell. This should fail with an ActivityID, which is a UUID required for the next step.
       ```Powershell
       Add-AppxPackage -ForceApplicationShutdown -ForceUpdateFromAnyVersion -Register .\AppxManifest.xml
       ```
       
    3. Run the command below in PowerShell. This should print the log of the failed operation.
       ```Powershell
       Get-AppPackageLog -ActivityID <UUID>
       ```
    4. Check the log for the reason of failure and fix it.

### How do I update without losing any of my apps and data on Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA)

1. [Download the latest build](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds#downloads) (that you want to update to)
2. Make sure Windows Subsystem For Android is not running (Click on "Turn off" in the WSA Settings and wait for the spinning loader to disappear)
2. Using 7-Zip, WinRAR or any other tool of choice, open the .zip file 
3. Within the .zip archive open the subfolder (Example: WSA_2xxx.xxxxx.xx.x_xx_Release-Nightly-with-magisk-xxxxxxx-MindTheGapps-xx.x-RemovedAmazon)
4. Select all the files that are within this subfolder and extract them to the current folder where the file for Windows Subsystem For Android are (the folder you extracted, and installed WSA from)
5. When prompted to replace folders, select "Do this for all current items" and click on "Yes" 
6. When prompted to replace files, click on "Replace the files in the destination"
7. Run  the ``Run.bat`` file
8. Launch Windows Subsystem For Android Settings app and go to the ``About`` tab using the sidebar
9. Check if the WSA version matches the latest version/ the version number that you want to update to

**How can I update Windows Subsystem For Android™ to a new version?**

- As Explained [Installation instructions](#installation). Download the [latest Windows Subsystem For Android™ Version](#downloads) and replace the content of your previous installation and rerun Install.ps1. Don't worry, your data will be preserved

**How do I update Magisk?**

- Do the same as updating Windows Subsystem For Android™.  Wait for a new MagiskOnWSA release that includes the newer Magisk version, then follow the [Installation instructions](#installation) to update

**Can I pass SafetyNet/Play Integrity?**

- No. Virtual machines like Windows Subsystem For Android™ cannot pass these mechanisms on their own due to the lack of signing by Google. Passing requires more exotic (and untested) solutions like: <https://github.com/kdrag0n/safetynet-fix/discussions/145#discussioncomment-2170917>

**What is virtualization?**

- Virtualization is required to run virtual machines like Windows Subsystem For Android™.  `Run.bat` helps you enable it. After rebooting, re-run `Run.bat` to install Windows Subsystem For Android™.  If it's still not working, you have to enable virtualization in your BIOS/UEFI. Instructions vary by PC vendor, look for help online

**Can I remount system partition as read-write?**

- No. Windows Subsystem For Android™ is mounted as read-only by Hyper-V. You can, however, modify the system partition by creating a Magisk module, or by directly modifying the system.img file

**I cannot adb connect localhost:58526**

- Make sure developer mode is enabled. If the issue persists, check the IP address of Windows Subsystem For Android™ on the Settings ---> Developer page and try 

   ```
   adb connect ip:5555
   ```

**Magisk online module list is empty?**

- Magisk actively removes the online module repository. You can install the module locally or by 
  
   **Step 1** 
      
      adb push module.zip /data/local/tmp

   **Step 2**  

      adb shell su -c magisk --install-module /data/local/tmp/module.zip


**How do I uninstall Magisk?**

- Request, using [Issues](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/issues), a Windows Subsystem For Android™ version that doesn't include Magisk from the [Releases page](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/releases/latest). Then follow the [Installation instructions](#installation)

**Can I switch between OpenGApps and MindTheGapps?**

- No. GApps will no longer function. Do a [complete uninstallation](#uninstallation) before switching

**How do I install custom Magisk or GApps?**

- To request a build with custom Magisk or GApps, feel free to open an issue in the [Issues page](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/issues.) You can also achieve this by using the [MagiskOnWSALocal](https://github.com/LSPosed/MagiskOnWSALocal) Script and following the provided instructions located in the repo.
