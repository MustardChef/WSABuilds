#### Known Issues that may affect your WSA experiences:
- ***GApps Issues : https://github.com/LSPosed/MagiskOnWSALocal/issues/595***
- ***Folder Issue : Long folder name for the WSA Folder (auto generated by the MagiskOnWSALocal script) may cause WSA to not start. Rename the folder to ``WSA`` after extracting and before installing WSA.***

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; 
&gt; If you have the official Windows Subsystem For Android™ installed, you must [completely uninstall](#uninstallation) it to use MagiskOnWSA. 

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt;  
&gt; In case you want to preserve your data from the previous installation (official or MagiskOnWSA), you can backup Userdata.vhdx, located at ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\userdata.vhdx`` before uninstallation and restore it after installation. A guide for this process is located further down in this README.

---

### Text Guide:
1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/releases/latest)
2. In the latest release, go to the Assets section and download the Windows Subsystem For Android™ version of your choosing (do not download "Source code")
3. Extract the .7z archive and rename the folder (that you extracted) to ``WSA``
4. Delete the .7z archive
5. Move the newly extracted folder to a suitable location (Documents folder is a good choice), as you will need to keep the folder on your PC to use MagiskOnWSA

&gt; [!NOTE]   
&gt; If you're updating WSA, merge the folders and replace the files for all items when asked

6. Open the Windows Subsystem For Android™ folder: Search for and double-click `Run.bat`
   - If you previously have a MagiskOnWSA installation, it will automatically uninstall the previous one while preserving all user data and install the new one, so don't worry about your data.
   - If the popup windows disappear without asking administrative permission and Windows Subsystem For Android™ is not installed successfully, you should manually run Install.ps1 as administrator:
      
      - Press Win+x and select Windows™ Terminal (Admin)
      
      - Input the command below and press enter, replacing {X:\path\to\your\extracted\folder} including the {} with the path of the extracted folder
        ```Powershell
        cd "{X:\path\to\your\extracted\folder}"
        ```  
        
      - Input the command below and press enter   
        ```Powershell
        PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Install.ps1
        ```
        
      - The script will run and Windows Subsystem For Android™ will be installed
      - If this workaround does not work, your PC is not supported for WSA
      
7. Once the installation process completes, Windows Subsystem For Android™ will launch (if this is a first-time install, a window asking for consent to diagnositic information will be shown instead. Sometimes two identical windows will show, this is fine and nothing bad happens if you click OK in both windows)
8. Click on the PowerShell window, then press any key on the keyboard, the PowerShell window should close
9. Close File Explorer
10. **Enjoy**

--- 

### Notice (Applicable for both Windows 10 and 11):

1. You can NOT delete the Windows Subsystem For Android™ installation folder.
   What `Add-AppxPackage -Register .\AppxManifest.xml` does is to register an appx package with some existing unpackaged files,
   so you need to keep them as long as you want to use Windows Subsystem For Android™. 
   Check https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/appx/add-appxpackage?view=windowsserver2022-ps for more details.
2. You need to register your Windows Subsystem For Android™ appx package before you can run Windows Subsystem For Android™. 
   For [WSABuilds](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds) and [MagiskOnWSALocal](https://github.com/LSPosed/MagiskOnWSALocal) users, you need to run `Run.bat` in the extracted dir.
   If the script fails, you can take the following steps for diagnosis (admin privilege required):
    1. Open a PowerShell window and change working directory to your Windows Subsystem For Android™ directory.
    
    2. Run the command below in PowerShell. This should fail with an ActivityID, which is a UUID required for the next step.
       ```Powershell
       Add-AppxPackage -ForceApplicationShutdown -ForceUpdateFromAnyVersion -Register .\AppxManifest.xml
       ```
       
    3. Run the command below in PowerShell. This should print the log of the failed operation.
       ```Powershell
       Get-AppPackageLog -ActivityID <uuid>
       ```
    4. Check the log for the reason of failure and fix it.

### How do I update without losing any of my apps and data on Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA)

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Make sure that WSA has been turned off from the settings and that tools such has WSA-System-Control, WSA-Sideloader, WSAPacman etc are not running.

1. [Download the latest build](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds#downloads) (that you want to update to)

2. Make sure Windows Subsystem For Android is not running (Click on "Turn off" in the WSA Settings and wait for the spinning loader to disappear)

2. Using 7-Zip, WinRAR or any other tool of choice, open the .7z archive 

3. Within the .7z archive, open the subfolder 
    - Example: 
        - WSA_2xxx.xxxxx.xx.x_xx 
        
        or 
        
        - WSA_2xxx.xxxxx.xx.x_xx_Release-Nightly-with-magisk-xxxxxxx-MindTheGapps-xx.x-RemovedAmazon)

4. Select all the files that are within this subfolder and extract them to the current folder where the file for Windows Subsystem For Android (the folder you extracted, and installed WSA from) are located 

5. When prompted to replace folders, select "Do this for all current items" and click on "Yes" 

6. When prompted to replace files, click on "Replace the files in the destination"

7. Run  the ``Run.bat`` file

8. Launch Windows Subsystem For Android Settings app and go to the ``About`` tab using the sidebar

9. Check if the WSA version matches the latest version/ the version number that you want to update to

&gt; [!NOTE]   
&gt;
&gt; If you want to preseve your data, make a backup of the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\userdata.vhdx` file. After uninstalling, copy the VHDX file back to the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Package\MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache` folder. For a more comprehensive and detailed guide, take a look at the **Backup and Restore section** in this README markdown

### To remove WSA installed through WSABuild:

- **1.)** Make sure that Windows Subsystem For Android™ is not running
<br/>

- **2.)** Search for ``Windows Subsystem For Android™ Settings`` using the built-in Windows Search, or through Add and Remove Programs and press uninstall
  
<br/>

- **3.)** Delete the WSA folder that you extracted and Run.bat was run from to install WSA (MagiskOnWSA folder)

<br/>

- **4.)** Go to ``%LOCALAPPDATA%/Packages/`` and check if the folder: ``MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe`` is still present:
   - If the folder is still present: ****Delete it****
      - If you get an error that states that the file(s) could not be deleted, make sure that WSA is turned off
   - If the folder does not exist: ****Skip this step****
           
<br/>

### To remove WSA installed from the Microsoft Store: 
        
   - **1.)** Search for ``Windows Subsystem For Android™ Settings`` using the built-in Windows Search, or through Add and Remove Programs and press uninstall

## Backing Up Your Userdata
      
In order to make a backup of your WSA data you must copy the ``Userdata.vhdx`` (which includes, but is not limited Android Apps and their data, settings etc.), located at ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\userdata.vhdx``, to a safe location     
      
## Restoring Your Backup

Before attempting to restore your backup, you must remove WSA if installed. Then before you run the ``Run.bat`` script (to reinstall WSA after removing it), you need to remove these lines from ``Install.ps1``, located in the your extracted WSA folder:
      
      
&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; The Lines (as shown below) that you need to remove in ``Install.ps1`` may vary depending on the type of WSA Build that you are trying to install.    
      

#### Android Settings:
```pwsh
Start-Process "wsa://com.android.settings"
```
#### Official Magisk:
```pwsh
Start-Process "wsa://com.topjohnwu.magisk"
```
#### Magisk Delta:
```pwsh
Start-Process "wsa://io.github.huskydg.magisk"
```
#### Magisk Alpha:
```pwsh
Start-Process "wsa://io.github.vvb2060.magisk"
```
#### Google Play Store:
```pwsh
Start-Process "wsa://com.android.vending"
```
#### Amazon Appstore:
```pwsh
Start-Process "wsa://com.amazon.venezia"
``` 

After removing the lines above, run the script. 

When the Powershell window states "Press any key to quit", at that time multiple dialouge boxes will open:

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; ****Ignore these and do not click on anything or close these popups****

Go to ``%localappdata%\Packages`` and (if these folders/directory do not exist, create them) in ``MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\`` paste the userdata.vhdx

Now close the popups and run WSA and your userdata should hopefully be restored

**Help me, I am having problems with the MagiskOnWSA Builds**

- Open an [issue in Github](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/issues) or [join the Discord](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds#join-the-discord) and describe the issue with sufficent detail

**Help me, I am having problems with installing Windows Subsystem For Android™ on Windows™ 10**

- I am not working on the patch, and nor claim to.  Open an issue in the Discord or Github, and I will try to assist you with the problem if possible. For full support visit the project homepage and open an issue there: https://github.com/cinit/WSAPatch/issues/

**How do I get a logcat?**
- There are two ways:
   ```
   adb logcat
   ```
   or

-  Location in Windows ---&gt;<br/> `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\diagnostics\logcat`

**Can I delete the installed folder?**

- No.

**How can I update Windows Subsystem For Android™ to a new version?**

- As Explained [Installation instructions](#installation). Download the [latest Windows Subsystem For Android™ Version](#downloads) and replace the content of your previous installation and rerun Install.ps1. Don't worry, your data will be preserved

**How do I update Magisk?**

- Do the same as updating Windows Subsystem For Android™.  Wait for a new MagiskOnWSA release that includes the newer Magisk version, then follow the [Installation instructions](#installation) to update

**Can I pass SafetyNet/Play Integrity?**

- No. Virtual machines like Windows Subsystem For Android™ cannot pass these mechanisms on their own due to the lack of signing by Google. Passing requires more exotic (and untested) solutions like: <https: 145#discussioncomment-2170917="" discussions="" github.com="" kdrag0n="" safetynet-fix="">

**What is virtualization?**

- Virtualization is required to run virtual machines like Windows Subsystem For Android™.  `Run.bat` helps you enable it. After rebooting, re-run `Run.bat` to install Windows Subsystem For Android™.  If it's still not working, you have to enable virtualization in your BIOS/UEFI. Instructions vary by PC vendor, look for help online

**Can I remount system partition as read-write?**

- No. Windows Subsystem For Android™ is mounted as read-only by Hyper-V. You can, however, modify the system partition by creating a Magisk module, or by directly modifying the system.img file

**I cannot adb connect localhost:58526**

- Make sure developer mode is enabled. If the issue persists, check the IP address of Windows Subsystem For Android™ on the Settings ---&gt; Developer page and try 

   ```
   adb connect ip:5555
   ```

**Magisk online module list is empty?**

- Magisk actively removes the online module repository. You can install the module locally or by 
  
   **Step 1** 
      
      adb push module.zip /data/local/tmp

   **Step 2**  

      adb shell su -c magisk --install-module /data/local/tmp/module.zip


**How do I uninstall Magisk?**

- Request, using [Issues](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/issues), a Windows Subsystem For Android™ version that doesn't include Magisk from the [Releases page](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/releases/latest). Then follow the [Installation instructions](#installation)

**Can I switch between OpenGApps and MindTheGapps?**

- No. GApps will no longer function. Do a [complete uninstallation](#uninstallation) before switching

**How do I install custom Magisk or GApps?**

- To request a build with custom Magisk or GApps, feel free to open an issue in the [Issues page](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/issues.) You can also achieve this by using the [MagiskOnWSALocal](https://github.com/LSPosed/MagiskOnWSALocal) Script and following the provided instructions located in the repo.

|---------|---------------|-------|
| Multi-touch | ✅ | Demo: [Arcaea](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ph411n7M5)
| Virtual Wifi (VirtWifi) | ✅
| Bluetooth | ❌ ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/WSA/issues/103))
| IPv6 | ✅ | Loading `ipv6.google.com` in Fennec F-Droid on a PC with IPv6 access, works well
| Fingerprint Reader | ❌ | Test failed on ROG Flow X13, with SATRIA app

| OpenGL ES 3.1 | ❌
| Vulkan | ✅ | Added as experimental feature in [2307.40000.2.0](https://github.com/microsoft/WSA/discussions/374)

### Workarounds

#### VPN

There is no `com.android.vpndialogs` in WSA. However, it's possible to manually grant the VPN activation permission with AppOps via `adb shell`:

```shell
appops set [package name] ACTIVATE_VPN allow
```

#### Launching Android Apps with URI scheme

Microsoft provides a custom URI scheme for WSA, making it easier to launch apps:

```shell
wsa://[App Package Name]
```

For example, to launch Apple Music in WSA, use:

```shell
wsa://com.apple.android.music
```

| eGovPH | 2.0.4 | 13 | ⚠️ | Tested on a WSA install with GMS and It's also recommended to turn off Developer Options before starting this app.  The app doesn't start properly if you didn't grant the permissions beforehand in android settings. For eReport, the app can't progress beyond the Current Location permission prompt as clicking the "Enable Location" doesn't do anything (even with the location permission granted for WSA in Windows); the workaround is to access it via the Suggested eGovPH Services part (found on the Home tab). eKYC verification is problematic as the built-in laptop camera is wonky with eGovPH's image handling, affecting the verification process (this also applies if you're registering an account from the same device for its face verification). Some pages display no content (notably FAQs and application details on some cases) |  Basic features work such as navigating through the app features/pages. The PhilSys Digital ID page works as well and able to recognize it in the verification site from another device. Recommended to use an up-to-date version of Android System WebView since the app mostly relies on it.

### Is this GitHub Repo affiliated with Microsoft™?

<center><h3>NO!</h3></center>

###### - Microsoft and the Dev team at MSFT are the developers of Windows Subsystem For Android. We do not claim to develop, or have a part in developing this emulator. We also have no real influence on the direction of development of WSA and nor do we claim to.

###### - What the WSABuild repo does is that it provides prebuilt WSA builds with Root and GMS built using the MagiskOnWSALocal project (and WSAPatch for the Windows 10 patch.) That is that we simply modify the emulator to add extra functionality to it.

###### - All this is, is an unofficial project not related in any way to Microsoft and the team working on Windows Subsystem For Android.
